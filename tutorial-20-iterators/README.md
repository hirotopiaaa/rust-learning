### The Book

Chapter 13: Closures: Anonymous Functions that Can Capture Their Environment

### Summary

In Rust, iterators are a powerful abstraction that allow you to work with sequences of data in a concise and efficient manner. They provide a way to process collections like arrays, vectors, and other iterable data structures.

- Iterators provide a flexible and efficient way to process sequences.
- Rustâ€™s iterators are lazy and only perform work when consumed.
- Iterator adaptors allow you to transform and filter sequences, while consumers produce final results.

### Notes

#### What is an Iterator?

In Rust, iterators are a powerful abstraction that allow you to work with sequences of data in a concise and efficient manner. They provide a way to process collections like arrays, vectors, and other iterable data structures. Here's a breakdown of how iterators work in Rust and some important concepts:

1. What is an Iterator?

An iterator in Rust is any type that implements the Iterator trait, which requires a definition for the next method. The next method returns an Option type:

    Some(item) if there are elements left to iterate over.
    None if the iterator is exhausted.

The basic signature of the next method looks like this:

```rust
fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
```

#### Creating Iterators

Rust provides several ways to create iterators. Commonly, you use the `.iter()` method on collections:

```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut iter = numbers.iter();
```

Here, `iter` is an iterator over numbers. You can use `.next()` to get items one by one:

```rust
assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));
assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&2));
assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&3));
assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);
```

#### Iterator Adaptors and Consumers

Rust has two main types of iterator methods:

- Adaptors: These transform iterators into other iterators (e.g., `.map()`, `.filter()`).
- Consumers: These consume the iterator to produce a value or perform an action (e.g., `.collect()`, `.fold()`, `.for_each()`).

Examples:

- Mapping over an iterator:

```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
```

- Filtering an iterator:

```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let evens: Vec<i32> = numbers.into_iter().filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).collect();
```

#### Ownership and Iterators

Rust has three ways to iterate over a collection, depending on ownership:

- `.iter()`: Immutable reference iteration (&T).
- `.iter_mut()`: Mutable reference iteration (&mut T).
- `.into_iter()`: Consumes the collection, taking ownership and yielding owned values (T).

#### Lazy Evaluation

Iterators in Rust are lazy, meaning they do nothing until they are consumed. For example, methods like `.map()` and `.filter()` do not produce values until the iterator is consumed using a consumer method like `.collect()`.

#### Loops vs Iterators

In Rust, using iterators is often more idiomatic than using loops. Iterators provide a more concise and expressive way to work with collections, and they can be combined with closures and other functional programming techniques to create powerful data processing pipelines.

Iterators is a higher-level abstraction that allows you to focus on what you want to do with the data rather than how to iterate over it. Using iterators can allow us to access the nice methods that come with them, such as `map`, `filter`, `fold`, etc.
